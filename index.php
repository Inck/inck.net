							<h1><a href="page.php?number=C17">Advanced Rhetoric and Discourse, A Final in Five Parts</a></h1>
							<cite>by Nicholas Hall on <a href="">May 17th, 2005</a></cite>
							<p>The order in which I have prioritized these methods as to their relevance to the advertisement in question is very close to the order in which I prioritize them as to their relevance to the study of advertising in general. The only difference is that, due to the ad's clear reliance on a logical argument, I place Argument theory ahead of <a href="">Temptation theory</a>, when I generally consider temptation theory to be the most applicable to the study of advertisement.</p>
							<p>This ad is quite explicitly an argument. It presents a formal syllogism, untruncated and unequivocated, in its text: "Your sense of taste returns when you quite smoking. That means you can taste... the nicotine gum you're using to help you quit. Which is why you should quit with Nicorette fresh mint." The major premise is that your sense of taste will return, the minor that nicotine gum has a taste. Ergo, you should chew nicotine gum that tastes good. This is a rare trick for an advertisement, whose taste for truth and logic leave something to be desired. Advertisements must necessarily avoid logic, as their basic premise is completely illogical. Most ads are selling a brand.</p>

									<p>Nicorette is only one type of nicotine replacement and only one type of nicotine gum. There is no practical argument to be made for buying one product over another of equivalent function simply because of its name or its manufacturer.</p>
									<p>This advertisement avoids logic, as well, and does so by presenting the reader with a logical argument for a product that is not in fact the product that the ad is selling. It explicitly convinces you of the importance of a quality that its product has, but which is not exclusive to its product. It conflates the idea of buying a good-tasting nicotine gum with the idea of buying Nicorette fresh mint gum. The operative phrase for this logically weaker part of </p>

									<p>the argument is presented with greater visual force. "Nicorette fresh mint is the best tasting nicotine gum." That this is an entirely subjective claim shows where the argument in this ad seeks to mislead.</p>
									<p>The logic fails here in two places: One, its claim is not fact. Two, its claim is not necessarily relevant. Even if one were to accept the claim, it would in fact only enter into a set of factors determining the attractiveness of the product.</p><p>For instance, if an unflavored or less successfully flavored generic nicotine gum were significantly cheaper, its affordability might still trump <a href="page.php?number=C17&from=2450#continue">Continue on Page C17 &raquo;</a></p>

									<h2><a href="page.php?number=J12">Nick Avoiding</a></h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on <a href="">January 13th, 2010</a></cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">BROOKLYN</span> Nick is avoiding his departure today, packing sluggishly and pausing often to undertake distractions such as this first log entry of his trip written in the voice of a news article.</p>
									<p>He has boxed and stacked the majority of the things that he is leaving behind, but has only just begun to pack his suitcase with those things that he is taking with him.</p>
									<p>"I should think through the first few days to make sure I'm not forgetting anything essential," Nick recalls thinking earlier, looking away from a stack of shirts that he had been considering putting into his suitcase.</p>
									<p>During the day Nick has also prepared his old</p>

									<p>He also read the New York Times, New Republic, Talking Points Memo, and New Yorker home pages, and a selection of articles within each publication. He also watched the full interview of John Yoo by John Stewart on The Daily Show.</p>									<p>Nick could recall a number of times when he had delayed preparing for a move, which he considered his trip to Venezuela to more closely resemble than a vacation, given its length.</p>

									<h2><a href="page.php?number=L9">Prosodic Analysis of Plath's "Point Shirley"</a></h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on <a href="">December 24th, 2005</a></cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">COLLEGE</span> The most striking accentual cola of the last two stanzas of Plathâ€™s Point Shirley is that of three successive stresses. This cola can be expanded by default to include the two unstressed syllables at either end of the set. More than three stressed syllables would clearly be jarring, and outside of a list, difficult to construct in english, in which a plurality of the meter of even every day speech is iambic. For the purposes of this paper I will leave these unstressed syllables to be assumed.</p>

					<h2><a href="page.php?number=E1">World Reacts as Anxiety is Discarded</a></h2>
					<cite>by Nicholas Hall on <a href="">January 14th, 2010</a></cite>
					<p><span class="dateline">BROOKLYN</span> In a stunning turn of events today, Nick has decided against being anxious about the trip on which he is departing. The reaction around the world was overwhelming, as people, objects, and places displayed a remarkably less anxiety-provoking character to him.</p>
					<p>In countries around the world, crowds of people gathered to represent merely a minor obstacle to be navigated in the normal manner, some even presenting themselves as other individuals, capable of pleasant or wonderful conversations, and of being helpful.</p>
					<p>Until recently, people had been thought to be angrily organizing to present challenges </p>
					<p>to the unfettered forward progress of Nick's plans, presumed to be gathering in airports and other public spaces, committed to causing some sort of generalized distress or inconvenience to Nick.</p>
					<p>This is no longer feared to be the truth.</p>
					<p>The dramatic change came when Nick, having experienced this assumption of impending annoyance for several weeks, walked for an hour around the West Village in New York City and looked at buildings and groups of people from within a shell of pleasant anonymity. </p>
					<p>The supposed threat posed by the outside world was put back into its normal perspective, and the decision was made to no longer worry about it.</p>
					<p>"Yeah I was kind of  freaking out about everything and then I decided not to freak out anymore. So now I'm not freaking out," Nick said in a statement released to his friend last night at a bar.</p>
					<p>This is not the first time that this event has occurred. During the preparations for other major events in the past, Nick has undergone a similar process. <a href="page.php?number=F22&from=1264#continue">Continue on Page F22 &raquo;</a></p>

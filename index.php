								<h1><a href="page.php?number=A2">First Week Survived</a></h1>
								<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 21st, 2010</cite>
								<p><span class="dateline">Airports</span> Nick survived his first week of travel today, as one week passed without his metaphorical or literal demise. </p>
								<p>The possibility of his actual death is widely considered to have been nonexistent by authoritative strains of thought in his mind, however any number of other types of grievous emotional, psychological, or monetary harm could have presented themselves.</p>
								<p>Connections in Aruba and Caracas both presented these risks by way of parallel though different local forms theft.</p>
								<p>In Aruba the possibility of fiscal catastrophe loomed large as Nick attempted to traverse an area riddled with ungoverned groups that support their communities entirely through the questionable extraction of money from white people.</p>
								<p>Being a white person, Nick was found highly susceptible to this threat.</p>
								<p>However, with the exception of lodgings,</p>

										<p>which according to local custom must command a cost that can only be justified as the price of admission to the adjacent beaches, money was spent exclusively on taxis and small bottles of beer.</p>
										<p>A greater threat was considered to exist in Caracas, however, in the form of aggressive offers to exchange money at incorrect exchange rates by illicit taxi drivers. </p>

										<h2>Weekend Retreats: An Expensive Dinner with Americans</h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 24th, 2010</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">Vamos al Centro</span> With a wonderful palette of rosy, pale, and red faces seared ever-so-slightly, this weekend retreat to an expensive hotel restaurant with a large group of American students proved a panorama of colors, like white, and a must-attend escape from the doldrums of cultural expansion and learning a new language.</p>
										<p>There's nothing like three hours of conversations in English to return you to a magical world of all conversations being had in English. And there's nothing like those conversations transpiring between college Juniors to bring back waves of blurry, disaffected memories that you can cherish as you drink heavily.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="set three_columns">
								<ul>
									<li class="module leader hyphenate">
										<p>The wonderful scenery will conjure images of why you first undertook this adventure. Through a broad, locked glass door you will see quaint food carts and groups of men smoking in the dark. Children will knock at the door to sell roses, and drug addicts mints, and you will take the opportunity to look away from them.</p>
										<p>A menu written in an illegible cursive will be your gateway to a selection of choice foods. Local steaks arranged preciously, and things that your dinner companions had no idea they were getting.</p>
										<p>The Weekend Retreater entreats you; take that long weekend, go somewhere you've never been. Then watch as the world surrounds you, without you having to so much as lift a finger, with people from places you've been many times. Savor it. Feel the comfort, and be sure to take a moment to breathe in and feel at your most superior.</p>

										<h2>Cell Phone No Longer Possessed</h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 16th, 2005</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">New York</span> The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo.</p>
										<p>"So as erin prob told you, i lost my phone in a cab and he kindly offered to allow me to buy yours..." Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.</p>
										<p>Given that Nick hates telephones in general and cellphones specifically for relocating the point of telecommunication between people to the body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, a new phone has not been purchased.</p>
										<p>Calls placed to Nick requesting comment had not been returned at press time and never will be.</p>

						<h2>Venezuelan Nerds Found</h2>
						<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 23rd, 2010</cite>
						<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Venezuelan nerds were found today, in La Facultad de Ingeniería, a building of the Universidad de Los Andes in La Hechizera, a neighborhood set into the mountains above Mérida.</p>
						<p>Wearing glasses, slouching, and installing Ubuntu, these nerds were found to be nerds very similar to those common in the United States.</p>
						<p>They were also found to be earnest, smart, and avidly practicing their yo-yo skills.</p>
						<p>Websites were shared and programing languages discussed. There was agreement in the excellence of CodeIgniter, and in the eventual interestingness of learning Ruby on Rails.</p>
						<p>Conversations about Ruby on Rails tended to be short due to its name being difficult as fuck to say with a Spanish pronunciation.</p>
						<p>Potential projects were breathlessly discussed and imagined, despite Nick's complete inability to use the subjunctive verb form, in which any such conversation would be correctly conducted.</p>
						<p>One such project, creating a communal space for users to discuss and share information on the fact that both power and water go out several unscheduled times per day, was considered particularly interesting.</p>
						<p>Interesting was both the content of the idea, a serious and worthwhile project if it were to encourage any changes, and the nature of the ensuing discussion.</p>
						<p>The word 'contenido' was learned to be the word in Spanish for 'content' and was subsequently used excessively to describe the process of planning the functionality of the product under discussion.</p>
						<p>The parallels with such conversations had in English were found to be amusing and slightly comforting.</p>
						<p>After these conversations Nick retreated into his computer, an escape found to be much more normative among this group, and undertook some technical work.</p>
						<p>As such this publication now offers its news for consumption through RSS technology.</p>

								<h1><a href="page.php?number=N1">Real Things Happen</a></h1>
								<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 27th, 2010</cite>
								<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Real things happened yesterday and Monday in Mérida, as students took to the streets to protest the shutdown of RCTV, one the last remaining broadcast networks in Venezuela which had been openly critical of the Chávez government.</p>
								<p>On Monday students were seen throwing rocks and moving in groups, armed with molotov cocktails fashioned out of regional beer bottles. Many had t-shirts tied around their faces. They blocked traffic in a series of streets in the downtown area, using chairs and tires that were then set on fire. </p>
								<p>Police in riot gear massed throughout the downtown area over the course of the afternoon.</p>
								<p>Later in the evening the downtown area had become impassable, as much due to a domino traffic effect as to specific blockades. Busses were not running into the the downtown area from the outlying neighborhoods, and taxis were largely unable to pass the lower streets.</p>
								<p>Most people walked home, and the streets were relatively safe in all but the southern</p>

										<h2>Weekend Retreats: An Expensive Dinner with Americans</h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 24th, 2010</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">Vamos al Centro</span> With a wonderful palette of rosy, pale, and red faces seared ever-so-slightly, this weekend retreat to an expensive hotel restaurant with a large group of American students proved a panorama of colors, like white, and a must-attend escape from the doldrums of cultural expansion and learning a new language.</p>
										<p>There's nothing like three hours of conversations in English to return you to a magical world of all conversations being had in English. And there's nothing like those conversations transpiring between college Juniors to bring back waves of blurry, disaffected memories that you can cherish as you drink heavily.</p>

										<p>The wonderful scenery will conjure images of why you first undertook this adventure. Through a broad, locked glass door you will see quaint food carts and groups of men smoking in the dark. Children will knock at the door to sell roses, and drug addicts mints, and you will take the opportunity to look away from them.</p>
										<p>A menu written in an illegible cursive will be your gateway to a selection of choice foods. Local steaks arranged preciously, and things that your dinner companions had no idea they were getting.</p>
										<p>The Weekend Retreater entreats you; take that long weekend, go somewhere you've never been. Then watch as the world surrounds you, without you having to so much as lift a finger, with people from places you've been many times. Savor it. Feel the comfort, and be sure to take a moment to breathe in and feel at your most superior.</p>

										<h2>Cell Phone No Longer Possessed</h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 16th, 2005</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">New York</span> The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo.</p>
										<p>"So as erin prob told you, i lost my phone in a cab and he kindly offered to allow me to buy yours..." Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.</p>
										<p>Given that Nick hates telephones in general and cellphones specifically for relocating the point of telecommunication between people to the body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, a new phone has not been purchased.</p>
										<p>Calls placed to Nick requesting comment had not been returned at press time and never will be.</p>

						<h2>Venezuelan Nerds Found</h2>
						<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 23rd, 2010</cite>
						<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Venezuelan nerds were found today, in La Facultad de Ingeniería, a building of the Universidad de Los Andes in La Hechizera, a neighborhood set into the mountains above Mérida.</p>
						<p>Wearing glasses, slouching, and installing Ubuntu, these nerds were found to be nerds very similar to those common in the United States.</p>
						<p>They were also found to be earnest, smart, and avidly practicing their yo-yo skills.</p>
						<p>Websites were shared and programing languages discussed. There was agreement in the excellence of CodeIgniter, and in the eventual interestingness of learning Ruby on Rails.</p>
						<p>Conversations about Ruby on Rails tended to be short due to its name being difficult as fuck to say with a Spanish pronunciation.</p>
						<p>Potential projects were breathlessly discussed and imagined, despite Nick's complete inability to use the subjunctive verb form, in which any such conversation would be correctly conducted.</p>
						<p>One such project, creating a communal space for users to discuss and share information on the fact that both power and water go out several unscheduled times per day, was considered particularly interesting.</p>
						<p>Interesting was both the content of the idea, a serious and worthwhile project if it were to encourage any changes, and the nature of the ensuing discussion.</p>
						<p>The word 'contenido' was learned to be the word in Spanish for 'content' and was subsequently used excessively to describe the process of planning the functionality of the product under discussion.</p>
						<p>The parallels with such conversations had in English were found to be amusing and slightly comforting.</p>
						<p>After these conversations Nick retreated into his computer, an escape found to be much more normative among this group, and undertook some technical work.</p>
						<p>As such this publication now offers its news for consumption through RSS technology.</p>

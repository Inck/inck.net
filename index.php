								<h1><a href="page.php?number=n1">Real Things Happen</a></h1>
								<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 27th, 2010</cite>
								<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Real things happened yesterday and Monday in Mérida, as students took to the streets to protest the shutdown of RCTV, one the last remaining broadcast networks in Venezuela which had been openly critical of the Chávez government.</p>
								<p>On Monday students were seen throwing rocks and moving in groups, armed with molotov cocktails fashioned out of regional beer bottles. Many had t-shirts tied around their faces. They blocked traffic in a series of streets in the downtown area, using chairs and tires that were then set on fire. </p>
								<p>Police in riot gear massed throughout the downtown area over the course of the afternoon.</p>
								<p>Later in the evening the downtown area had become impassable, as much due to a domino traffic effect as to specific blockades. Busses were not running into the the downtown area from the outlying neighborhoods, and taxis were largely unable to pass the lower streets.</p>
								<p>Most people walked home, and the streets were relatively safe in all but the southern</p>

										<h2><a href="page.php?number=g1">Weekend Retreats: An Expensive Dinner with Americans</a></h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 24th, 2010</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">Vamos al Centro</span> With a wonderful palette of rosy, pale, and red faces seared ever-so-slightly, this weekend retreat to an expensive hotel restaurant with a large group of American students proved a panorama of colors, like white, and a must-attend escape from the doldrums of cultural expansion and learning a new language.</p>
										<p>There's nothing like three hours of conversations in English to return you to a magical world of all conversations being had in English. And there's nothing like those conversations transpiring between college Juniors to bring back waves of blurry, disaffected memories that you can cherish as you drink heavily.</p>

										<p>The wonderful scenery will conjure images of why you first undertook this adventure. Through a broad, locked glass door you will see quaint food carts and groups of men smoking in the dark. Children will knock at the door to sell roses, and drug addicts mints, and you will take the opportunity to look away from them.</p>
										<p>A menu written in an illegible cursive will be your gateway to a selection of choice foods. Local steaks arranged preciously, and things that your dinner companions had no idea they were getting.</p>
										<p>The Weekend Retreater entreats you; take that long weekend, go somewhere you've never been. Then watch as the world surrounds you, without you having to so much as lift a finger, with people from places you've been many times. Savor it. Feel the comfort, and be sure to take a moment to breathe in and feel at your most superior.</p>

										<h2><a href="page.php?number=t4">Venezuelan Nerds Found</a></h2>
										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 27th, 2010</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Venezuelan nerds were found today, in La Facultad de Ingeniería, a building of the Universidad de Los Andes in La Hechizera, a neighborhood set into the mountains above Mérida.</p>
										<p>Wearing glasses, slouching, and installing Ubuntu, these nerds were found to be nerds very similar to those common in the United States.</p>
										<p>They were also found to be earnest, smart, and avidly practicing their yo-yo skills.</p>
										<p>Websites were shared and programing languages discussed. There was agreement in the excellence of CodeIgniter, and in the eventual interestingness of learning Ruby on Rails. <a href="page.php?number=t4&from=91#continue">Continue on Page T4 &raquo;</a></p>

						<h2><a href="page.php?number=r5">The Apartment Hunt: Mérida</a></h2>
						<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 29th, 2010</cite>
						<p>Searching for an apartment is always a hunt, but especially here in hip and edgy Mérida, especially when your prime location is on the other side of a student riot.</p>
						<p>Nicholas Hall began his search with a conversation at an unlikely event: a meet-and-greet between American students and Venezuelans who want to meet American students. The date was set for Monday morning, and then the search was on.</p>
						<p>Nicholas was looking to move up from his current digs, where he's lived since he arrived in the city a week ago. A room in a large house in the northern quarter, the old place was always meant to be a starter home, and he was ready to move on by the end of the month.</p>
						<p>The first location, a swank, geriatrically-decorated three-bedroom, two-bath in a heavily guarded community compound proved just a little too rich, and Nicholas thought he could bring the price down. Playing a little hardball never hurts when swimming with the sharks of real estate, and playing like you don't understand any of the words they're using to up-sell you on a ridiculous place can take you a long way, as our Hunter learned.</p>
						<p>Moving on to a fresh first-floor apartment in an active student neighborhood, our hunter and his de facto realtor encountered something unexpected and exciting: The local student scene out and looking engaged, in violent political protest, wearing interesting masks, swirling molotov cocktails, passionately sharing views on social matters.</p>
						<p>These signs of local culture left Nick almost sold, along with the miniscule rent and single bus to his school, and he signaled that he was ready to close a deal, in a couple days when he had confirmed with others that the miniscule rent was sufficiently miniscule.</p>
						<p>After some research and market-comparisons, Nick was ready to move forward, and informed his self-defined realtor. The conversation then turned to payment transaction methods, and that's when things got really interesting.</p>
						<p>Tune in to the next installment of the Hunt to find out the smart inside-game on how to pay for shit here.</p>

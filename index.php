							<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 21st, 2010</cite>
							<p><span class="dateline">MÃ©rida</span> Nick survived his first week of travel today, as one week passed without his emotional or literal demise. </p>
							<p>The possibility of his actual death is widely considered to have been nonexistent by authoritative strains of thought in his mind, however any number of other types of grievous emotional, psychological, or monetary harm could have presented themselves.</p>
							<p>Connections in Aruba and Caracas both presented these risks by way of parallel though different local forms theft.</p>
							<p>In Aruba the possibility of fiscal catastrophe loomed large as Nick attempted to traverse an area riddled with ungoverned groups that support their communities entirely through the questionable extraction of money from white people. </p>
							<p>Being a white person, Nick was found highly susceptible to this threat.</p>

									<h2><a href="page.php?number=J12">Departure Avoided</a></h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 13th, 2010</cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">BROOKLYN</span> Nick is avoiding his departure today, packing sluggishly and pausing often to undertake distractions such as this first log entry of his trip written in the voice of a news article.</p>
									<p>He has boxed and stacked the majority of the things that he is leaving behind, but has only just begun to pack his suitcase with those things that he is taking with him.</p>
									<p>"I should think through the first few days to make sure I'm not forgetting anything essential," Nick recalls thinking earlier, looking away from a stack of shirts that he had been considering putting into his suitcase.</p>
									<p>During the day Nick has also prepared his old iPod to take with him in place of his iPhone,</p>

									<p>which will be left behind, unchecking in iTunes a number of albums that would not fit and which he does not listen to.</p>
									<p>He also read the New York Times, New Republic, Talking Points Memo, and New Yorker home pages, and a selection of articles within each publication. He also watched the full interview of John Yoo by John Stewart on The Daily Show.</p>									<p>Nick could recall a number of times when he had delayed preparing for a move, which he considered his trip to Venezuela to more closely resemble than a vacation, given its length.</p>
									<p>Often when leaving for college, moving to new apartments, or relocating to new cities, Nick has delayed packing until the day of his departure, ultimately doing so in a disorganized flurry. <a href="page.php?number=J12&from=1290#continue">Continue on Page J12 &raquo;</a></p>

									<h2>"Sell Phone" (Ha Ha)</h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on December 24th, 2005</cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">Pants</span> The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo, who is the shit.</p>
									<p>"Dude I heard you were trying to sell your phone. I totally just lost mine," Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.</p>
									<p>Given that Nick hates telephones in general and the cellphone specifically for its relocation of the point of immediate verbal but non-visual contact between people to the individual's body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, a new phone has not been purchased.</p>
									<p>Calls made to Nick had not been returned at press time and probably never will be.</p>

					<h2>World Reacts as Anxiety is Rejected</h2>
					<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 14th, 2010</cite>
					<p><span class="dateline">West Village</span> In a stunning turn of events today, Nick has decided against being anxious about the trip on which he is departing. The reaction around the world was overwhelming, as people, objects, and places displayed a remarkably less anxiety-provoking character to him.</p>
					<p>In countries around the world, crowds of people gathered to represent merely a minor obstacle to be navigated in the normal manner, some even presenting themselves as other individuals, capable of pleasant or wonderful conversations, and of being helpful.</p>
					<p>Until recently, people had been thought to be angrily organizing to present challenges </p>
					<p>to the unfettered forward progress of Nick's plans, presumed to be gathering in airports and other public spaces, committed to causing some sort of generalized distress or inconvenience to Nick.</p>
					<p>This is no longer feared to be the truth.</p>
					<p>The dramatic change came when Nick, having experienced this assumption of impending annoyance for several weeks, walked for an hour around the West Village in New York City and looked at buildings and groups of people from within a shell of pleasant anonymity. </p>
					<p>The supposed threat posed by the outside world was put back into its normal perspective, and the decision was made to no longer worry about it.</p>
					<p>"Yeah I was kind of freaking out about everything and then I decided not to freak out anymore. So now I'm not freaking out," Nick said in a statement released to Liz Tan last night at Corner Bistro.</p>
					<p>This is not the first time that this event has occurred. During the preparations for other major events in the past, Nick has undergone a similar process.</p>
					<p>In almost all recorded cases, the process resulted in the cessation of the freaking out, and in a majority of cases that cessation came in the form of a decision, which is weird and seems to imply some future course of action.</p>

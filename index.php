								<h2><a href="page.php?number=c5" name="c5">Cultural Experience Had</a></h2>
								<cite>by Nicholas Hall on February 8th, 2010</cite>
								<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Nick had a cultural experience Saturday, according to the hangover he had Sunday morning and the generalized sense of joy.</p>
								<p>An event whose name translates roughly into "The Crowning of the Queen of the Fairs" was the specific event seen to have catalyzed this experience, but the experience was more broad and primarily tangential to the event.</p>
								<p>The Crowning was held in the Plaza de Toros, normally used for bullfights, but on this the first night of the Fairs, used for a pop-music concert and beauty pageant, the winner of which was Crowned said Queen of said Fairs.</p>
								<p>Salsa music, meringue music, and forms of popular music largely understood as issuing from salsa and meringue music, were played.</p>
								<p>Additionally were seen the drinking of beer and plastic bottles of sangria, the throwing of the plastic bottles, fights, and an impromptu breakdancing session atop a dangerous internal roof.</p>

										<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 30th, 2010</cite>
										<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> A conversations about whorehouses was barely understood on Saturday, in the kitchen of the house where Nick resides, between Ramon, a man who occasionally stays in the house, and two other men, a local friend named Nicolás, and another who is apparently a lawyer.</p>
										<p>The lawyer and Nicolás both grew up in Mérida, and Ramon grew up in Caracas, making his perspective on the existence of the whorehouse under discussion less valid than those of the other men.</p>
										<p>The whorehouse was barely understood to have at times been a movie theatre as well, or perhaps to have been nominally a movie</p>

										<p>theatre while in fact operating as a whorehouse.</p>
										<p>The words 'puta' and 'putaria' were interpreted to signify that the conversation being had concerned whorehouses. </p>
										<p>Additionally the words 'mierda' and 'coño' were in heavy use. Their purpose was understood primarily to be essentially that of punctuation and emphasis.</p>
										<p>The conversation was believed to have concerned at times the specific year in which the supposed movie theatre had operated in this capacity. The years 1975, 1974, and 1970 were debated has having potentially been the year of the building's provision of said services.</p>
										<p>The night began with the innocent eating of dinner, during which 'Cuba Libres' were offered, thereby commencing the conversation in question. <a href="page.php?number=h7&from=214#h7">Continued, with Letters to the Editor, on Page H7 &raquo;</a></p>

										<p>On Monday students were seen throwing rocks and moving in groups, armed with molotov cocktails fashioned out of regional beer bottles. Many had t-shirts tied around their faces.

						<h2><a href="page.php?number=r16" name="r16">The Apartment Hunt: The Big Deal: Money Matters: Traveler's Journal: Things</a></h2>
						<cite>by Nicholas Hall on February 12th, 2010</cite>
						<p>In this installment in The Hunt, we look at the Deal of the Week, and learn some lessons from the Money Man to record in our Traveler's Journal.</p>
						<p>Last we heard from our Hunter-Dealer-Man-Traveler, he had been in the thick of negotiations for a new property-adventure-home. After some hairy experiences and excursions and confabs he had decided on the place of his dreams/budget.</p>
						<p>When we left him off, he was working through the tangle of paying someone a few hundred dollars, and struggling with new complexities like talking, writing emails, and receiving any kind of response. All of these things can pose new challenges to someone new to the world of financio-real-adventure-talks.</p>
						<p>In response to the volatile worlds of these various mythologized market segments that we present as digestible power narratives, Nick had to make some tough decisions and have some tough conversations.</p>
						<p>First he had to write another email in Spanish to the lady with the apartment and await a response, and then ask the lady with his current apartment if he could stay on, and how much that would cost. After lengthy ten-minute negotiations they agreed on a ridiculously equitable price and then started drinking rum listening to everyone else discuss politics.</p>
						<p>Then Nick had to break off talks with the other lady, which first meant a long discovery process of how to even get in touch with her. That ultimately came to fruition when she walked into his school one day. After a tense series of exchanges over how to say things in Spanish, the lady figured out what he was saying and was mildly disappointed.</p>
						<p>Lessons Learned: In today's market you have to be aggressive, and you can't be afraid to push the limits of the words you know how to say. Forces may buffet from every direction, but most important is that you set a location and a price and stick to it, unless something changes and you don't really want to any more.</p>

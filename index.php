							<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 21st, 2010</cite>
							<p><span class="dateline">Mérida</span> Nick survived his first week of travel today, as one week passed without his metaphorical or literal demise. </p>
							<p>The possibility of his actual death is widely considered to have been nonexistent by authoritative strains of thought in his mind, however any number of other types of grievous emotional, psychological, or monetary harm could have presented themselves.</p>
							<p>Connections in Aruba and Caracas both presented these risks by way of parallel though different local forms theft.</p>
							<p>In Aruba the possibility of fiscal catastrophe loomed large as Nick attempted to traverse an area riddled with ungoverned groups that support their communities entirely through the questionable extraction of money from white people.</p>
							<p>Being a white person, Nick was found highly susceptible to this threat.</p>

									<h2><a href="page.php?number=P5">World Reacts as Anxiety is Decided Against</a></h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 14th, 2010</cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">West Village</span> In a stunning turn of events today, Nick has decided against being anxious about the trip on which he is departing. The reaction around the world was overwhelming, as people, objects, and places displayed a remarkably less anxiety-provoking character to him.</p>
									<p>In countries around the world, crowds of people gathered to represent merely a minor obstacle to be navigated in the normal manner, some even presenting themselves as other individuals, capable of pleasant or wonderful conversations, and of being helpful.</p>
									<p>Until recently, people had been thought to be angrily organizing to present challenges to the</p>

									<p>unfettered forward progress of Nick's plans, presumed to be gathering in airports and other public spaces, committed to causing some sort of generalized distress or inconvenience to Nick.</p>
									<p>This is no longer feared to be the truth.</p>
									<p>The dramatic change came when Nick, having experienced this assumption of impending annoyance for several weeks, walked for an hour around the West Village in New York City and looked at buildings and groups of people from within a shell of pleasant anonymity. </p>
									<p>The supposed threat posed by the outside world was put back into its normal perspective, and the decision was made to no longer worry about it.</p>
									<p>"Yeah I was kind of freaking out about everything and then I decided not to freak out anymore. So now I'm not freaking out," Nick said in a statement <a href="page.php?number=P5&from=1406#continue">Continue on Page F22 &raquo;</a></p>

									<h2>Cell Phone No Longer Possessed</h2>
									<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 16th, 2005</cite>
									<p><span class="dateline">Midtown</span> The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo.</p>
									<p>"So as erin prob told you, i lost my phone in a cab and he kindly offered to allow me to buy yours..." Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.</p>
									<p>Given that Nick hates telephones in general and the cellphone specifically for its relocation of the point of immediate verbal but non-visual contact between people to the individual's body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, a new phone has not been purchased.</p>
									<p>Calls to Nick requesting comment had not been returned at press time and never will be.</p>

					<h2>Venezuelan Nerds Discovered</h2>
					<cite>by Nicholas Hall on January 23rd, 2010</cite>
					<p>Venezuelan nerds were discovered today, in La Facultad de Ingeniería, a building of the Universidad de Los Andes in La Hechizera, a neighborhood set into the mountains above Mérida.</p>
					<p>Wearing glasses, slouching, and installing Ubuntu, these nerds were found to be nerds very similar to those common in the United States.</p>
					<p>They were also found to be earnest, smart, and avidly practicing their yo-yo skills.</p>
					<p>Websites were shared and programing languages discussed. There was agreement in the excellence of CodeIgniter, and in the eventual interestingness of learning Ruby on Rails.</p>
					<p>Conversations about Ruby on Rails tended to be short due to its name being difficult as fuck to say with a Spanish pronunciation.</p>
					<p>Potential projects were breathlessly discussed and imagined, despite Nick's complete inability to use the subjunctive verb form, in which any such conversation would be correctly conducted.</p>
					<p>One such project, creating a communal space for users to discuss and share information on the fact that both power and water go out several unscheduled times per day, was considered particularly interesting.</p>
					<p>Interesting was both the content of the idea, a serious and worthwhile project if it were to encourage any changes, and the nature of the ensuing discussion.</p>
					<p>The word 'contenido' was learned to be the word in Spanish for 'content' and was subsequently used excessively to describe the process of planning the functionality of the product under discussion.</p>
					<p>The parallels with such conversations had in English were found to be amusing and slightly comforting.</p>
					<p>After these conversations Nick retreated into his computer, an escape found to be much more normative among this group, and undertook some technical work.</p>
					<p>As such this publication now offers its news for consumption through RSS technology.</p>

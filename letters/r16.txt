There's no way negotiations on the deal that Mr. Hall discusses are going to go through. One the government gets its hands on the contracts its all going to go to hell.

I've been in the equity-travel-credit-leasing business for fifty-eight years and I can tell you that I see problems on the horizon for this idea.

I just want to thank Mr. Hall for writing this tremendous article. Ever since my mother had an unrelated experience at a grocery store and my husband died of facial cancer I have been looking for advice on how to temporarily rent a room in a vaguely foreign country.

This is just a godsend. I hope Mr. Hall will keep up the good work.

Based on my years of study of the topics that Mr. Hall is discussing, I can only add that the axiom "Money talks, bullshit walks," is true regardless of what language it is spoken in.

My father, an old C and assembly programmer who keeps the big IBM iron that handles your checking transactions running, told me once about the long-standing dispute between the workstation and the dumb terminal. 

We're still having that argument. 

PCs versus the cloud and the web versus apps come down to that same old thing. Should we centralize and manage our resources, parceling out only access to that center? Or should we each do our own work, perhaps synchronizing, backing up, and publishing aspects of it to some centrally accessible point?

It strikes me that any argument I'm having that my father also had will not be quickly resolved, and may have no singular solution. Neither the central nor the distributed will win in the end. The generative qualities of distributed work and the editorial quality of centralized work each have merit. Most likely technical trends will oscillate between them, each microgeneration reacting to the previous one with the opposite of its work, which will inherently resemble that of two generations back.

It seems we might thereby end up at a balance: Each generational rejection will have to lose some steam, like a pendulum winding down, eventually yielding a succession of generations that will be just barely different from the last, forming some kind of consensus. Maybe. Maybe instead such a process would never end, as the minutia of technologies expand in the mind of practitioners, absorbing any new homogeny in its infinitely diminishing perspective.

The way this will end is through the rejection of these options as all-encompassing. Instead we will come to see centralization and distribution as we see procedure and object-orientation, simply patterns with their particular application.

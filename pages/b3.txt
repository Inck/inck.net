News Conceit Found Lame
November 2nd, 2010

This Article -- The voice in which this article is written, and which all other news stories are written, is lame, according to an expert who once used it disingenuously for approximately one month.

Critics were quick to express disagreement, though, issuing a series of statements aimed at contradicting the thing with which they had found fault.

"That's really not the way we look at it, and I think that looking at it that way really does a disservice to the way in which it aught to be considered, considering that that way is significantly more accurate," offered one such skeptic.

Still, the possibility that the signification of accuracy through the use of rote passive-intransitive sentence construction and formulaic quotation of opinion holders defined exclusively by their ability to hold an opinion, showed some support among the American People. 

Many Americans expressed deep concern in response to a question design to provoke their concern.

Asked whether they thought the liberal mainstream media had a liberal or conservative bias, sixty-five percent of respondents responded that it had a liberal bias. The poll was conducted on November 1st and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points for some reason.

This striking result bodes poorly for those who will position themselves against it, setting up a pitched and feverish battle for the soul of the answer to the question that was asked.

A spokesman for the Council to Fight Back Against This Thing Now issued the following statement: "We wholeheartedly disagree with the opinion expressed and feel it is just another example of the frightening turn our society has taken towards the dangerous perspective that was expressed in this opinion."

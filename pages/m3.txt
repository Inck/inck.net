News Voice Lame

Internet -- The voice in which this article is written, and which all other news stories are written, is lame, according to an expert who has been using it disingenuously for approximately one month.

Critics were quick to express disagreement, though, issuing a series of statements aimed at contradicting the thing with which they had found fault.

"That's really not the way we look at it, and I think that looking at it that way really does a disservice to the way in which it aught to be considered, considering that that way is significantly more correct."

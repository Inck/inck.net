Blog Avoided
October 30th, 2010

The Internet -- This blog was avoided today, and every day prior, beginning on February 12th, totaling over eight months that nothing was written on it, according to the date on the previous entry to this one.

Reached for comment, the author of the blog made a depressed face and then wrote this entry, summoning what energy he could to overcome the crippling inertia that had come to define his thoughts on the blog.

A number of factors were seen as having prevented contribution to the blog from becoming a regular habit, including distraction, fear and perfectionism.

Experts in the field maintain that entries should be contributed to the blog with a regularity but also a casual feeling of simply recording small thoughts and experiences. 

This, they say, will allow it to become a regularized practice, and to iteratively become an increasingly interesting outlet.

Those invested in its maintenance, however, were quick to point out that incredibly interesting and insightful things could be written immediately if the proper attention and time were paid to them, and that that attention could quite possibly be paid to them tomorrow, but only if the insignificant task of writing this small, pointless entry were avoided, just for today.

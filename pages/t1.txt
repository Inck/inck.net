"Sell Phone"

The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo, who is the shit.

"Dude I heard you were trying to sell your phone. I totally just lost mine," Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.

Given that Nick hates telephones in general and the cellphone specifically for its relocation of the point of immediate verbal contact to the individual body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, this was not seen to be a problem.

Calls made to Nick had not been returned at press time and probably never will be.

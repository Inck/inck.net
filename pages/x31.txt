Cell Phone No Longer Possessed
January 16th, 2010

The cellphone previously owned by Nick is no longer owned by Nick, instead being owned by Mo.

"So as erin prob told you, i lost my phone in a cab and he kindly offered to allow me to buy yours..." Mo was quoted as emailing to Nick.

Given that Nick hates telephones in general and the cellphone specifically for its relocation of the point of immediate verbal but non-visual contact between people to the individual's body rather than a prescribed location such as a house or office, with specific social expectations attached to their entrance, a new phone has not been purchased.

Calls to Nick requesting comment had not been returned at press time and never will be.

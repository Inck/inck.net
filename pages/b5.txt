Facebook is Microsoft
December 6th, 2010

The recent string of 'events' held in a room at Facebook headquarters seemed like the college theatre department version of the Broadway show of an Apple event. First announcing new privacy 'features', and then the new Facebook 'email' system, Mark Zuckerberg tried to cast himself in the lead role of the reality-distorting salesman and ringmaster that Steve Jobs brought into technology. He failed not because of his performance or the production around it, but because he just didn't have the goods.

Apple is able to present their new products as world-changing innovations because a few times in history they truly have been. Facebook on the other hand hasn't innovated anything, just driven through by brute force the implementation of a collection of obvious ideas, ending up at the right place at the right time.

In this, Facebook has been an impressive operation, and is a credit to the capacity of its founder, a young nerd gifted in the combined mechanics of consumer applications development and cold-blooded capitalism, but in neither separately. In this, Facebook has stepped into the space that Microsoft occupied for so many years. They are a dominant product that you have little choice in using if you want to take advantage of a new capacity, in this case the ambient social interactions offered by the social networking concept. As a symptom of that dominance, their product is inferior.

Facebook is a design failure in ways very similar to how Windows was. It obscures important functions by attempting to give access to a large number of unimportant functions. There is a good argument to be made that Facebook's privacy problem is not only, or even primarily, about any fundamental disrespect that they have for privacy. To the contrary, they have robust privacy control mechanisms that allow a user to restrict their information in a very granular way, providing themselves a great deal of privacy should they know how to configure it.

But users don't configure things. At the margins they can and will, but a good product makes the majority of its decisions itself. In this way Facebook undermines the privacy of its users. It's tempting to think of it as intentional, a sort of passive-aggressive approach to acquiring sellable user data. But it never pays to impugn someone's motives. Probably the company and what it produces are somply subject to the fundamental misanthropy and artlessness necessarily common to people who spend all day communicating with computers in languages that express only absolutes. Technology companies that focus only on technology and the business of being a company, always have this problem. Design is a bridge from those worlds to the customers who are their sustenance.

If Facebook is Microsoft, then who is its Apple? Who is the innovator and principled product operation soldiering on at its feet, but poised to overtake it at the next big shift? There may not be one clear player, but instead a community of players. (A network of them, fittingly.) Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, their ilk and their successors are building the technology and maintaining the agility necessary to survive the inevitable upheaval against "social networking" as a product.

Because social networking is not a product. It's not even a technology. It's a feature, a communication channel that is new in that it can hew to the social conventions of those who use it. The telephone forced us to create new conventions to suit it. Social networks can be made to apply the conventions we need to have good relationships. But not by a large, financially-motivated company steered by a young man. They will arise from a series of systems growing and dying as each one better, or in its own specific way, encapsulates how we want to know each other online, through photos, through 140 byte quips, through locations that we visit.

Another thing that was not a product was computers. They were a tool for doing certain things in our lives. Microsoft thought of the IBM clone as the unending road into the future, marked by megahertz and adorned with increasingly fancy graphics flying by along the side. But that road has stopped, or at least narrowed to make room for the road of mobile devices. And as they try to merge onto it, Microsoft finds they are crowded out by Apple, the competitor who always kept their eye on what the user wanted, and stepped in with exactly what that was while the giant slept at the wheel.

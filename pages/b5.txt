Facebook is Microsoft
May 28th, 2012

Facebook is an impressive operation, and a credit to the capacities of its founder, a young nerd gifted in the combined mechanics of consumer applications development and cold-blooded capitalism, but in neither separately, and uninspired in the work of making great products. It’s in that sense that Facebook has stepped into the space that Microsoft occupied for so many years. They are a dominant product that we have little choice in using if we want to take advantage of a new capacity, in this case the ambient social interactions offered by the concept of social networking. It is both a cause and symptom of this dominance that their product is inferior.

Facebook is a design failure in ways very similar to how Windows was. It obscures important functions by attempting to give users access to a large number of unimportant functions. You could say its problem is that it concerns itself with functions. Functions, ‘features’ you could also say, of the site are the units by which it’s grown. This is opposed to any holistic consideration of the needs of its users for a particular task. The new Timeline design of the profile page is some of the first work they’ve done showing any broad reconsideration of an aspect of the user’s experience.

Last year's redesign of their privacy configuration interface was a step in that direction too, but merely a tardy afterthought, a Wizard tacked on to soothe a serious user revolt. There’s a good argument to be made that Facebook’s privacy problem is not only about a fundamental disinterest that they have in our privacy. To the contrary, they have always had robust privacy control mechanisms that allow a user to restrict their information in a very granular way, providing themselves a great deal of privacy should they know how to configure it.

But users don’t configure things. At the margins they can and will, but a good product makes the majority of its decisions for itself. In this way Facebook undermines the privacy of its users through poor design. 

So if Facebook is Microsoft, then who is its Apple? Who is the innovator and principled product operation soldiering on at its feet, poised to overtake it at the next big shift? There may not be one clear player, but instead a community of players. (A network of them, fittingly.) Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, their ilk and their successors are building distributed technologies and maintaining the agility necessary to survive the inevitable upheaval against “social networking” as a product.

Social networking is not actually a product. It’s not a technology. It’s not even a feature. It’s a language, a social milieu, a communication channel that is new in that it hews to social conventions. The telephone was a technology, and it forced us to create new conventions to suit it. So was email, and text messages were a product of the two. Social networks are a set of behaviors in software that can model the social conventions we need to have good relationships. 

It’s no wonder that the social conventions defined by one large, financially-motivated company steered by a 20-something computer nerd sometimes strain our relationships. Social conventions have always grown organically, and so will their expressions in software. They will arise from a series of systems growing and dying as each one better encapsulates how we want to know each other online, through photos, through 140 byte quips and quotations, through locations that we visit, etc.

Another thing that was not actually a product was personal computing. It was a new set of processes for doing things in our lives, some made possible by technology, some just modified by it. Microsoft thought of the IBM clone as their unending road into the future, marked by megahertz and adorned with increasingly fancy graphics flying by along the side. But that road stopped. And as they tried to merge onto it, Microsoft found they were crowded out by Apple, the competitor who always kept their eye on what the user truly needed or wanted from new technology, and stepped in with a new design for what that could be while the giant slept at the wheel.

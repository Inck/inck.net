Large organizations fail due to their need to abstract between subsections of themselves in order to function.

Government abstracts between people and their laws. 

Financial products abstract between people and their money.

We accept abstractions--money, regulatons, spokespersons--as a part of the daily things we do because we believe in the notion of abstraction, of substitution: That this thing can be said to equal that thing, and there after be used in that thing's place.

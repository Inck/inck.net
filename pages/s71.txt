Of Poetry and Politics
October 22nd, 2020

The days we have grown ages older through 
were like a poem that we had to learn 
to read, for poetry is not intended 
for attention's cultivated crop 
but is a field of noemata grown 
to be a garden we may feed our children 
from, as we fed it, our child with dirt 
and water and the sun we helped along 
the upward path it was already on 
at birth from warming earth we found already
tilled by others, mothers and adoptive 
fathers, who perhaps abandoned harvest 
season for the hunt but came inside 
when winter proved their independance was 
dependant on the interplay of children 
they and mothers were once all together 
after they were neither future men 
or women, all hermaphroditic spores 
afloat in amniotic fog of secret 
clearings in the woods or parks or streets.

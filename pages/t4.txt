Venezuelan Nerds Found
January 23rd, 2010

Venezuelan nerds were found today, in La Facultad de Ingeniería, a building of the Universidad de Los Andes in La Hechizera, a neighborhood set into the mountains above Mérida.

Wearing glasses, slouching, and installing Ubuntu, these nerds were found to be nerds very similar to those common in the United States. 

They were also found to be earnest, smart, and avidly practicing their yo-yo skills.

Websites were shared and programing languages discussed. There was agreement in the excellence of CodeIgniter, and in the eventual interestingness of learning Ruby on Rails.

Conversations about Ruby on Rails tended to be short due to its name being difficult as fuck to say with a Spanish pronunciation.

Potential projects were breathlessly discussed and imagined, despite Nick's complete inability to use the subjunctive verb form, in which any such conversation would be correctly conducted.

One such project, creating a communal space for users to discuss and share information on the fact that both power and water go out several unscheduled times per day, was considered particularly interesting. 

After these conversations Nick retreated into his computer, an escape found to be much more normative among this group, and undertook some technical work.

As such this publication now offers its news for consumption through RSS technology.

Drinking Water
I was a boy fascinated with light and water. First, water.
In preschool we had a time of the day for playing with water. A clear blue tub wheeled out on a cart. Colorful plastic tubes and funnels floated on the water that filled it, tools for directing and holding and shaping water. We wore plastic aprons to keep our clothes dry and poured the water from container to container, through the toys and through the air.
I remember the water as a substance of light more than of matter. Parallel lines of light, and concentric circles of light, and outward spirals of light. The water was the body carrying the face of the light.
Other things had a face of light, windows and airborne dust and the face of my watch at the correct angle between the lamp and the ceiling. Windows were the purest light and airborne dust the most alive, the watch the most powerful. The water was the most expressive face of light.
Any shape that water was run over made an unrelated shape of light. What mechanism transformed one shape into the other? This was my question, which was never answered. I don't ask it now, but take it as an answer. A mechanism transforms one into the other, I can say. This goes for any one and any other. The mechanism cannot be seen, only its input and output.
But much can be inferred from that, especially if everything has one of these machines sustaining it, and in turn sustains another.
Each one leaves its mark vaguely over the image of what made it. The shape of the hand is in the shape of the light, but so is the wobbling shape of the water. And so everything is vaguely wobbling with its being churned through being, as though the world of matter was drunk on the drink of energy, the man of the world drunk on the drink of change.

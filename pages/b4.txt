Metaphor Extended
November 3rd, 2010

Watching President Obama respond to a question intended only to confront him with the fact that he had said negative things about Republicans during the midterm campaign, I was happy to see him extend his metaphor out further. Mostly because this is how I talk. I can extend a metaphor forever.

Specifically, the reporter had brought up Obama's metaphor of a car for our country, having been driven into a ditch by Republicans, and subsequently pushed back out by Democrats, only to have Republicans request the keys back. Obama accepted that perhaps Americans didn't consider the car of our country out of its economic ditch. He continued that the saw it as moving out, but still basically stuck. He offered that maybe they now want the Republicans to get back there and push too. 

I've got another metaphor, also car-related, that I'd like to offer for how the press and the political public misses the point of what Obama is often trying to do to solve our problems. It's an idea that I see much more manifested in the thinking of people my age, who voted for him, and often simply not penetrate the minds of older people, for reasons I'll hope to go on about some day.

The idea's simple: Two people can decide to do the same thing for two different reasons. You can want to go get a slurpee and I can want to go get a magazine, and we can then drive to the gas station together and solve both our problems. Indeed, if you think about, we really only had one, shared problem: getting to the gas station. Your slurpee and my magazine were just details, actually irrelevant, and maybe not worth discussion. 

The press, and politicians on the campaign trail, talk like gas stations only had slurpees, or only had magazines. Then they talk about what is more important for a gas station to have, magazines or slurpees. Then magazine lovers get angry because we think there's only going to be slurpees at gas stations now, and slurpee lovers get angry about the same thing, or, well, the opposite thing, which is really the same thing.

What we should do is just shut up about slurpees and magazines and just get in the car and go, buy whatever we want when we get there, and then drive back and go home and enjoy our respective products.

What we should do is just shut up sometimes, recognizing that we can create conflict simply by talking about it.
